Investors are looking to start the Citi Bike program in Des Moines, IA and have asked us to look at ridership data from the same program in New York City to provide guidance on how they can structure the program to make it most successful.

Here are some insights for the visualizations, in order of the story:
- 81% of ridership in New York was from subscribers.  The company should push to drive as much initial subscriptions as possible because you can see in the data that it leads to increased usage.
- Even though the program was deployed across all of New York, overall ridership was concentrated in certain geographical areas which likely correspond to either population density or commercial real estate.  Citi should maximize use of capital and deploy bikes in similar areas in Des Moines, rather than put the bikes where they won't be used.
- Rides rarely last more than 60 minutes, and most are around 10 minutes.  This can impact the type of bike deployed and help price to maximize profit.
- The heat map shows ridership is most concentrated during standard commute times during teh week and in the afternoon and early evening on weekends.  This can help determine when to staff up with support personnel to troubleshoot and accomodate riders.  This might also dictate when bikes can be pulled for servicing versus needing them to be deployed.
- Because there might be both male and female built bikes, it is important to consider gender versus rides.  This also might impact marketing approach.  Overall duration is not much different between gender, but overall ridership is much higher with males than females, which means the mix of types of bikes deployed should be adjusted accordingly.
- The percentage bar chart shows some slight variation between male and female ridership during time of day, which again may impact what bikes are deployed where and when.
- The last two plots look at similar detail as before but the main takeaways still hold: ridership is highest during work commute time and with male subscribers.
